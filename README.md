Pi calculated using 3 different methods:

  First is "Leibnez Method" which alternates the addition and then subtraction of odd fractions ex. 1/1 - 1/3 + 1/5. This method takes many iterations before it approaches a few decimal places to pi.
  
  Secondly is "Archiemedes" which produces Pi represented in Radians, The larger value N that is inputed into the formula produces a closer approximation of Pi.
  
  Lastly is "Chudnoviz Algorithm" that approaches the value of pi very quickly. This method accurately prints 40+ digits of Pi in as few at 70 iterations.
