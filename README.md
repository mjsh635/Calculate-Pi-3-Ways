Pi calculated using 3 different methods:

  First is "Leibnez Formula" which alternates the addition and then subtraction of odd fractions ex. 1/1 - 1/3 + 1/5. This formula takes many iterations before it approaches a few decimal places to pi.
  
  Secondly is "Archimedes Method" which produces Pi represented in Radians, The larger value N used with this method produces a closer approximation of Pi.
  
  Lastly is "Chudnovsky Algorithm" that approaches the value of pi very quickly. This algorithm accurately prints 40+ digits of Pi in as few at 70 iterations.
